## üß™ 1. Jupyter Notebook Setup (Locally)

Jupyter is ideal for writing and executing Python code with visual outputs like charts or tables.

### üîß Installation (Recommended via Anaconda)

#### ‚û§ Option 1: Install Anaconda (recommended for beginners)

* Download from: [https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)
* After installation, open Anaconda Navigator and launch **Jupyter Notebook**.

#### ‚û§ Option 2: Install using pip

```bash
pip install notebook
jupyter notebook
```

### üìò Official Docs & Tutorials:

* [Jupyter Notebook Beginners Guide](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html)
* [JupyterLab vs. Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
* [Interactive Jupyter Tutorial by DataQuest](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/)

### ‚úÖ Sample Workflow

```python
# In a notebook cell
import numpy as np
print("Jupyter is running!")
```

You can also use markdown for notes, images, equations, etc.

## üßë‚Äçüíª 2. VS Code for Python & Jupyter

### üîß Installation:

1. Download: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Install the **Python Extension** from Microsoft (search ‚ÄúPython‚Äù in Extensions).
3. Optionally install the **Jupyter Extension** for running `.ipynb` files.

### üìò Official Docs:

* [Python in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial)
* [Jupyter in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks)

### ‚úÖ Sample Setup

* Create a `.py` file or `.ipynb` notebook.
* Use:

  ```python
  print("VS Code running Python")
  ```
* VS Code integrates with Git, virtual environments, and Conda too.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è 3. Google Colab (Cloud-based Jupyter)

Colab is hosted by Google and requires no local installation. You can use GPU/TPU for free.

### üîß Access:

* Go to [https://colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com)
* Login with a Google account.
* Start a new notebook (File ‚Üí New notebook)

### üìò Official Docs & Help:

* [Colab User Guide (Google)](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html)
* [Colab GitHub Integration](https://colab.research.google.com/github/)

### ‚úÖ Features:

* Supports Markdown + Code
* Upload datasets or connect to Google Drive
* Use GPU via:
  `Runtime ‚Üí Change runtime type ‚Üí Hardware Accelerator: GPU`

### ‚úÖ Sample Colab Cell:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot([1,2,3,4],[10,20,25,30])
plt.title("Simple Plot in Colab")
plt.show()
```
