## üß† What is Supervised Learning?

Supervised learning is a type of **machine learning** where the model learns from a **labeled dataset** ‚Äî meaning for every input, the correct output is provided. The goal is to build a function that can map inputs to outputs and **make accurate predictions** on new data.

---

## üß© How Supervised Learning Works

1. **Dataset Preparation**
   Each data point is a pair:

   $$
   (X, y)
   $$

   * `X` = Input features (e.g., size of house, number of bedrooms)
   * `y` = Output label (e.g., price of the house)

2. **Model Training**
   The algorithm uses the dataset to learn a relationship between `X` and `y`.

3. **Prediction**
   After learning, the model can take a new `X_new` and predict `y_pred`.

4. **Evaluation**
   Metrics like **accuracy**, **mean squared error**, or **F1-score** are used to evaluate how well the model performs.

| Type           | Task                     | Output                              |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Classification | Assign to categories     | Discrete labels (e.g., "yes", "no") |
| Regression     | Predict continuous value | Real numbers (e.g., 12.5, 199.99)   |

## üìö Supervised Learning Algorithms ‚Äì Detailed

Below are **key supervised learning algorithms** with a short description and typical use cases.

---

### üî∑ 1. **Linear Regression (for Regression)**

* **Purpose**: Predict a continuous output.
* **Idea**: Fit a straight line that best describes the relationship between input and output.
* **Equation**:

  $$
  y = wX + b
  $$
* **Use Case**: Predicting house prices, sales forecasting.

---

### üî∑ 2. **Logistic Regression (for Classification)**

* **Purpose**: Predict binary outcomes (0/1).
* **Idea**: Uses the logistic (sigmoid) function to estimate probabilities.
* **Equation**:

  $$
  P(y=1) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(wX + b)}}
  $$
* **Use Case**: Spam detection, disease prediction.

---

### üî∑ 3. **Decision Tree**

* **Purpose**: Can be used for both classification and regression.
* **Idea**: A flowchart-like structure where each internal node represents a decision on a feature.
* **Pros**: Easy to understand and visualize.
* **Use Case**: Loan approval systems, medical diagnosis.

---

### üî∑ 4. **Random Forest**

* **Purpose**: Ensemble method for both classification and regression.
* **Idea**: Combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
* **Use Case**: Stock price prediction, sentiment analysis.

---

### üî∑ 5. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

* **Purpose**: Classification (and regression with SVR).
* **Idea**: Finds the best hyperplane that separates classes with the largest margin.
* **Use Case**: Image recognition, face detection.

---

### üî∑ 6. **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**

* **Purpose**: Classification and regression.
* **Idea**: Classify a new point based on the majority label among its `k` nearest neighbors.
* **Use Case**: Recommendation systems, handwriting recognition.

---

### üî∑ 7. **Naive Bayes**

* **Purpose**: Classification.
* **Idea**: Applies Bayes‚Äô Theorem assuming independence between features.
* **Use Case**: Text classification (spam, sentiment), document categorization.

---

### üî∑ 8. **Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)**

* **Purpose**: High-performance algorithm for both tasks.
* **Idea**: Builds models sequentially to correct the errors of previous ones.
* **Use Case**: Kaggle competitions, fraud detection, ranking problems.
